inherited from c, which itself inherited from assembly.

"The switch statement is basically an abstraction of a branch table, and a branch table also has an implicit fall-through and requires an additional jump instruction to avoid it."

"switch is not an alternative of if ... else statements in those languages. By using switch, we can match more than one condition at a time, which is highly appreciated in some cases." 


But it seems like this appreciation isn't that common: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/252489/why-was-the-switch-statement-designed-to-need-a-break
"Case fall through is so widely recognized as a defect that there's even a special comment convention, shown above, that tells lint "this is really one of those 3% of cases where fall through was desired.""
 
interesting use of switch (and generally interesting piece of code):
