** why was switch statement designed the way it was?
inherited from c, which itself inherited from assembly. [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/162590][stackexchange]]

"The switch statement is basically an abstraction of a branch table, and a branch table also has an implicit fall-through and requires an additional jump instruction to avoid it." [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/162575][stackexchange]]

"switch is not an alternative of if ... else statements in those languages. By using switch, we can match more than one condition at a time, which is highly appreciated in some cases." 


But it seems like this appreciation isn't that common: 

"Case fall through is so widely recognized as a defect that there's even a special comment convention, shown above, that tells lint "this is really one of those 3% of cases where fall through was desired.""

interesting use of switch (and generally interesting piece of code):
